  <h1>Welcome to the OpenAI Playground</h1>
  <div class="scroll">
    <p>OpenAI is an artificial intelligence research lab that aims to create safe and beneficial AI for all. Their
      mission is to ensure that artificial intelligence benefits humanity as a whole, by researching and developing
      advanced AI technologies, making them accessible to everyone, and promoting transparency and openness in AI
      research.</p>
    <p>The OpenAI Playground allows you to interact with one of their most advanced AI models, GPT-3 (Generative
      Pre-trained Transformer 3), through a simple and intuitive interface. Simply enter a prompt, and GPT-3 will
      generate a response that is often indistinguishable from human writing.</p>
    <p>Feel free to experiment with different prompts and see what kind of responses GPT-3 can generate. Just keep in
      mind that while GPT-3 is incredibly powerful, it is still a machine learning model and may generate responses that
      are inappropriate or offensive. Use the OpenAI Playground responsibly and have fun!</p>
    <p>OpenAI was founded in 2015 by a group of entrepreneurs, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk and technology executives
      Greg Brockman and Ilya Sutskever. Since then, the company has grown to become one of the most influential AI
      research labs in the world, with a focus on developing cutting-edge AI technologies that can benefit society in a
      wide range of ways.</p>
    <p>Whether you're an AI researcher, developer, or enthusiast, the OpenAI Playground is a powerful tool that can help
      you explore the capabilities of GPT-3 and discover new and innovative ways to use AI. So why not give it a try and
      see what you can create?</p>
